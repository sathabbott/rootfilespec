# Design of this package

This package is designed to deserialize binary data stored in ROOT files. It is
expected to be used in the context of another package, such as uproot, to fetch
data buffers (either locally or over the network) and provide them to this
package. It is also out of scope to take deserialized data and interpret it as
numpy or awkward arrays, with some minor exceptions when performance is
critical.

All deserialized data is stored as dataclass objects, inheriting from the base
`ROOTSerializable` type. This type has two main methods:

```python
Members = dict[str, Any]


@dataclasses.dataclass
class ROOTSerializable:
    @classmethod
    def read(cls: type[T], buffer: ReadBuffer) -> tuple[T, ReadBuffer]: ...

    @classmethod
    def update_members(
        cls, members: Members, buffer: ReadBuffer
    ) -> tuple[Members, ReadBuffer]: ...
```

The entry point for deserialization is the `read` method, which calls
`update_members` on all the subclasses in the inheritance tree to build up the
dictionary of class members (`Members`). Some classes may override `read` to
implement header parsing, or to handle layouts that are not simply in base class
order. The `read_mupdate_membersembers` method is only responsible for reading
the members of the class, not any base class members.

The `update_members` signature has a type alias in `serializable.py`:

```python
ReadMembersMethod = Callable[[Members, ReadBuffer], tuple[Members, ReadBuffer]]
```

these is used to define more advanced types, and to set up the `@serializable`
decorator.

Note that python dataclasses inherit members from multiple bases in reverse
order, so

```python
@dataclass
class Base1:
    a: int
    b: int


@dataclass
class Base2:
    c: int
    d: int


@dataclass
class Derived(Base1, Base2):
    e: int
```

will have the following order of members: `c, d, a, b, e`.

## Deserialization of numeric types

We use python `struct` to read numeric types from the buffer. Classes that
contain numeric members can be declared as:

```python
@serializable
class TMyClass(ROOTSerializable):
    fInt: Annotated[int, Fmt(">i")]
    fFloat: Annotated[float, Fmt(">f")]
```

where the `Fmt` type is a descriptor that will be used by the `@serializable`
decorator to auto-generate the appropriate `read_members` implementation.

## Annotated builtin types vs. objects

In several places, we have the option to "pythonize" the data structure, by
using builtin python types where they fully capture the semantics of a given
ROOT type. For example, `TString` is a variable length bytestring, and can be
represented as a `bytes` in python. We could have class members, such as the
name and title of a `TNamed`, either be represented by `TString`:

```python
@serializable
class TString(ROOTSerializable):
    fString: bytes


@serializable
class TNamed(TObject):
    fName: TString
    fTitle: TString
```

or by `bytes`:

```python
@serializable
class TNamed(TObject):
    fName: Annotated[bytes, TString]
    fTitle: Annotated[bytes, TString]
```

where the `@serializable` decorator takes care of the conversion between `str`
and `TString`. In this library, we will prefer to use the second approach when
feasible.

## Data Fetching and Locators

Many ROOT objects serve as references to data stored elsewhere in the file. For
example, a `TKey` points to a serialized object, an `REnvelopeLink` points to an
RNTuple envelope, and `TDirectory` points to a key list. To enable flexible I/O
patterns (synchronous, asynchronous, or batch fetching), this library separates
**data location** from **data fetching**.

### The Locator Pattern

The design follows this principle: **objects describe where data is; callers
decide when and how to fetch it**.

Each object that points to data provides a `*_locator` property that returns a
specialized locator object. The locator has:

- `offset: int` - byte offset in the file
- `size: int` - size of the data to be read
- `read_from(buffer) -> T` - deserializes the specific data type from the buffer

### Specialized Locator Classes

Even though `read_from` might appear to be implementable as `T.read(buffer)`,
sometimes a locator points to some wrapper of the data. For example, a `TKey`
points to the data prefixed by essentially another copy of itself, as a
validation check. This method allows the locator to handle the unwrapping logic,
and to return the correct type.

### Usage Pattern

```python
# 1. Get the locator (no I/O)
loc = root_file.tfile_locator
print(f"TFile at offset {loc.offset}, size {loc.size}")

# 2. Fetch the data (caller controls I/O)
buffer = fetch_data(loc.offset, loc.size)

# 3. Deserialize (locator knows the type)
tfile = loc.read_from(buffer)
```

### Batch Fetching Example

```python
# Collect all locators first (no I/O)
tfile_loc = root_file.tfile_locator
si_loc = root_file.streamerinfo_locator
locators = [tfile_loc, si_loc] if si_loc else [tfile_loc]

# Batch fetch (optimization opportunity)
# - Sort by offset for sequential reads
# - Combine nearby reads
# - Parallelize independent fetches
# - Check cache before fetching
buffers = [fetch_data(loc.offset, loc.size) for loc in locators]

# Deserialize all at once
tfile = tfile_loc.read_from(buffers[0])
streamerinfo = si_loc.read_from(buffers[1]) if si_loc else None
```

### A minimal synchronous reader

For the common case of one blocking read per locator, `rootfilespec.reader`
wraps the pattern above. It still does no I/O of its own: `FileReader.open`
takes a function returning the bytes at `(offset, size)`, and `open_path` is
that function for a local file.

```python
from rootfilespec.reader import open_path

with open_path("file.root") as reader:
    # reader.file, reader.tfile and reader.streamerinfo are already read, and
    # reader.fetch interprets data with the classes of the StreamerInfo record
    keylist = reader.keylist()  # of reader.rootdir, or of any TDirectory
    obj = reader.fetch(keylist["name"])  # a TKey is a locator
    element = reader.streamerinfos()[b"TNamed"].element(b"fName")
```

`reader.fetch(loc)` is `loc.read_from(buffer)` on the fetched bytes;
`reader.fetch.resolve(loc)` is for the locators that return the key at the front
of a record (`tfile_locator`, `streamerinfo_locator`, `keylist_locator`) and
reads the record as well; `reader.fetch.buffer(loc)` only fetches, which is the
callable `RNTuple.from_anchor` expects.
